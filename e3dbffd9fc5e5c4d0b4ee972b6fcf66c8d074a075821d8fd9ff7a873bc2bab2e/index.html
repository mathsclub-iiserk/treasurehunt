        <i>The treasure chest opens with a creak. Everyone gazes at the
        immaculate beauty of the chest, the intricate designs on its edges.
        Soon you realize, the chest has two compartments. On the top, there is
        a riddle - the final one, to unlock what you have wanted for years; no,
        decades! It's finally time! Will you get this one and bring peace and
        prosperity for all those who respect you? Will you be richer than Kings
        around the world? You close your eyes and recall the hidden note you
        had found from a sunken ship near an abandoned harbour one day - it
        promised a billion to its finder, in denominations of two. Is it your
        time at last? You solve the riddle, your eyes gleaming in the absolute
        insanity of winning the world.</i>
