        <i>You make your way for the harbour; today is sunny, bright, and
        definitely reflective of your state of mind. The voyage is nigh, and it
        won't be short - but who can dim the overwhelming confidence radiating
        from you! You might even pass a callous comment or two at boys in suits
        and girls in petticoats; walking hand in hand as the cool breeze grazes
        the cityfolk. Indeed, you can't help but look around as you plan to bid
        goodbye to civilization for a while.</i>

        Rajib and Ankita have just completed some meteorological measurements.
        They are resting on a knoll. A freight train is passing by, its
        locomotive fiercely fuming and huffing as it pulls the train up a
        slight incline.  The wind wafts evenly without gusts along the railroad
        bed.
        <br>
        <br>
        &ldquo;What wind speed did our measurements show?" Ankita asked.
        <br>
        &ldquo;Twenty miles per hour," said Rajib.
        <br>
        &ldquo;That is enough to tell me the train's speed," Ankita remarked.
        <br>
        &ldquo;Well now ..." Rajib seemed confused.
        <br>
        &ldquo;All you have to do is watch the movement of the train a bit more
        closely," Ankita smiled.
