        Akash is a jolly young man looking for all three - hence his utmost
        respect for you. But now you're in a pinch; only the two of you have
        taken this detour. With his fists and shovel, he can easily break down
        the stone wall standing tall before you. This whimsical chap has
        proposed that you beat him in a fun chess variant to make him work.
        <br><br> &ldquo;Gah, the gall!" you curse in your mind as you prepare to
        beat him. You are given the option to go first or second - what will
        you choose?  Can you even win? A wrong decision and you follow him.</i>

        A king is placed on the <i>a1</i> square (bottom left) of a chessboard.
        Two players take turns moving the king. In each turn, the king can move
        in one of three ways: one square upwards, one square to the right, or
        one square diagonally up and right. The player who ends up placing the
        king on the <i>h8</i> square (top right) wins. Assuming perfect play
        from both sides, is the game decisive? If it is, who wins?

        wins, answer <b>second</b>.</i>
