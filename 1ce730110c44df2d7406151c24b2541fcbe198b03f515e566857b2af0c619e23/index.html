        <i>You are busy trying to make sense of the problem when suddenly, you
        feel a jolt from behind. You slip off the narrow edge and fall
        backwards - the last thing you see is Angshu standing on the edge in
        your place, his hands stretched out towards you. Your vision is too
        blurry to see his expression; but as you plummet down head-first to
        your death, you wonder whether he was just trying to help you, or is
        secretly a traitor! You'll never know the answer. Maybe if you hadn't
        taken the narrow edge, you would've lived to see another day.</i>

        You took a false turn a couple of problems ago. Go back and correct
        your mistakes!
