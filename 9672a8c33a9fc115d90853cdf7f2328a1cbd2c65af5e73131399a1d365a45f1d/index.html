        <i>As the waves roll over your ship, as the water gushes into your room
        and fills it up, as the stench of blood from your crew engulfs you -
        you think of the game of matches you played. Maybe if you had done it
        correctly you wouldn't have argued with Ritam. Maybe it wouldn't have
        escalated into a fight that caused the fire. Maybe then you could have
        handled the storm better and saved everyone's lives. But no use
        thinking of it now: you close your eyes as the water embraces your
        fragile frame in its arms.</i>
